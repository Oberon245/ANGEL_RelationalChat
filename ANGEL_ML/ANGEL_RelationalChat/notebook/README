# ANGEL_RelationalChat

This repository contains the prototype for a real-time conversational simulation notebook as part of the ANGEL Project.  
The notebook, `ANGEL_RelationalChat.ipynb`, includes functionality for:

- Emotional token tagging
- Memory logging of user input and AI responses
- Real-time feedback of dominant emotional tone
- Adaptive AI responses based on emotional context
- Optional session log saving for longitudinal analysis

Future development goals include wrapping the logic into a live conversation interface using CLI or Streamlit.
